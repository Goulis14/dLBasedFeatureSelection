**Advancing Feature Selection with Deep Learning**
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my thesis on Advancing Feature Selection: Unveiling the Dominance of Deep Learning in Machine Learning. This research delves into the dynamic landscape of machine learning, with a focus on the emerging supremacy of deep learning techniques across a diverse array of applications.

**Research Focus**
At the heart of this study lies a meticulous examination of the critical role played by feature selection. This pivotal step not only refines data complexity but also amplifies model performance while enriching result interpretability. By meticulously contrasting traditional feature selection methods with cutting-edge deep learning approaches, this research seeks to illuminate the unfolding paradigm shift.

**Algorithmic Exploration**
The repository encapsulates the culmination of painstaking investigations. It compares well-established algorithms such as PCA, Lasso, and Random Forest against innovative methodologies like Autoencoders and Convolutional Neural Networks. This exploration is encapsulated in two core Python files: trFeatureSelection.py and featureSelectionDL.py, each dedicated to traditional and deep learning-based feature selection algorithms, respectively.

**Leveraging Powerful Libraries**
Implementing and evaluating these methods comprehensively was made possible through a robust stack of libraries including Keras, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow. These tools not only streamlined the experimentation process but also ensured results were both robust and reproducible.

**Breast Cancer Data from Wisconsin**
The findings underscore the remarkable efficacy of deep learning methods. This superiority is particularly pronounced within datasets characterized by intricate features and high dimensionality. Notably, the breast cancer data used in this research was sourced from the Wisconsin dataset, a public resource that can be accessed here.

**Pushing Boundaries with a Hybrid Approach**
Beyond observations, this repository introduces a novel hybrid approach. This method ingeniously fuses traditional techniques with the prowess of deep learning, aiming to elevate performance benchmarks further. The preliminary results of this hybrid fusion are promising, suggesting its applicability across domains spanning image classification, text analysis, and bioinformatics.

**Join the Journey**
